    "bio":"I recently decided to make a major career change after connecting with people through work and friends, and decided to follow this path to being a web developer. I've always loved a challenge and have felt the need to be in a job where I have to learn continuously. Since I began looking into this industry I have had so much fun growing and expanding my knowledge. I have experience with React, Node.js, HTML5, CSS, Javascript and JQuery and have, over the past 6 months, dedicated 40 hours a week to perfecting my full stack development skills. While my prior work experience is mostly in management, since January I have proven that I am capable of learning at an accelerated pace, and have completed the University of Oregonâ€™s Full Stack Development course with a 4.0 grade point average. During this time I have also worked a full time job and actively engaged in outside learning, working on a passion project utilizing AWS and Dynamo DB. I am confident that if given the opportunity, I will first meet, and then exceed your expectations. I am excited to learn and further develop skills in the future as part of a fast-paced, quality-driven team.",
